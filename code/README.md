Here's a brief tutorial on PyTorch, there's many on the internet. I recommend going through this in the following order
1. `pytorch101.ipynb`: Introduces you to the syntax and structure of PyTorch
2. `yourturn.ipynb`: Now that you're familiar, try playing around with training a neural network
3. `/MLOPs`: In real life you don't want to train in a jupyter notebook, here is a very light recommendation on how you can structure your codebase.
